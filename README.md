# PlaybackScrubber
### A slider control similar to UISlider that is geared towards controlling media playback and allows for customizing it's look and behavior. 

Looking closely at the scrubbing controls in media apps you will notice many intricacies in how they look and function. Apple TV has variable scrub speed, Hulu snaps at the initial scrub location with haptic feedback, YouTube shows chapters that highlight with haptic feedback. PlaybackScrubber seeks to emulate some of those behaviors, starting with section markers that are similar to YouTube's chapters.
